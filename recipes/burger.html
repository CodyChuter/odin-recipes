        <h3>Americas Favorite</h3>

        <p>This mouthwatering mashup is a staple of american cuisine. From every backyard barbecue to every ball game in America, the hamburger is always a crowd favorite.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz ground beef</li>
            <li>kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 slices cheese, such as swiss, cheddar, or american, optional</li>
            <li>2 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>topping of your choice, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Divide the beef into 2 patties, each about ¾-inch (2 cm) thick and 3 ½ inches (9 cm) in diameter. Transfer the patties to a plate or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li></p>

            <p><li>Remove the patties from the fridge and season on both sides with salt and pepper.</li></p>

            <p><li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil to the pan and swirl to evenly coat. Place the patties in the skillet and cook, undisturbed, on the first side for 5 minutes, until a brown crust forms.</li></p>

            <p><li>Flip the patties, top each with a slice of cheese (optional), and cook, undisturbed, until the patties are browned on the other side, the cheese is melted, and the meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes more for medium-well doneness.</li></p>

            <p><li>Remove the patties from the pan and transfer to a clean cutting board. Let rest for about 5 minutes.</li></p>
            
            <p><li>Place the burger patties on buns and serve with your favorite toppings and sauces.
